    <string name="product">We can realize how frustrating it can be when you have a punctured tyre or flat tyre, as it can occur at unexpected situations. This is why we import the perfect tyre sealing solution.Tyre Safe is tested in labs for durability to assure you high performance when applied on your tyres. Our dedicated teams of techies make sure that you stay assured that your vehicles are functioning in a perfect way without giving you any trouble when you are driving it. Be it a two wheeler or a four wheeler, we always make sure that you never face a situation of changing tyres once you hit a nail which might have a thickness of 4 mm to 10 mm in diameter.
     As the tyre rotates,TyreSafe spreads evenly over the inside surface. Immediately a puncture occurs, the air pressure in the tyre forces a millions of fibre particles and fillers suspended in the sealant to interlock and form a plug which prevents any further air loss. This process takes two to three revolutiions of the wheel and happens so fast that safe driving will remain unaffected.
